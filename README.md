The LRU is represented as least recently used data structure. In this data structure the elements which are least recently modified to the queue are modified upon any further requests.

In this project LRU is implemented, using mainly two data structures namely
1. Queue implemented using lists and
2. dictionary

The size of the queue is initially set, upon which any elements added to the queue at the rear end of the queue.

if the element is already present in the queue, the element is removed from the front end of the queue, the elements preceeding the removed element will be shifted rightwards by 1 bit and the removed element is added at the rear end of the queue.

all the elements in the queue will have a corresponding key value pairs in a dictionary, which will be modified with respect to the list elements.

This project involved concepts like:
1. lists and its manipulation
2. dictionary and its manipulation.
3. object oriented programming concepts.

This project gives a detail idea about LRU data structure.
